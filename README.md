## EmptyCup

This document provides crystal-clear instructions to set up, run, and preview this project.

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built using Node.js. It utilizes Express for routing, EJS for templating, and Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling.

## Prerequisites/Dependencies

To successfully run this project, you will need the following:

*   **Node.js (includes npm):** Node.js must be installed on your system. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Express**
*   **EJS**
*   **Mongoose**

Running `npm install` will handle installing Express, EJS, and Mongoose based on the [`package.json`](package.json:1).

## Setup Instructions

Please follow these steps explicitly to set up the application:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project's root directory (e.g., `cd path/to/project_folder`).
3.  Install the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install Express, EJS, Mongoose, and other required packages.

## Running the Application

Please follow these steps to run the application:

1.  Initialize the application data by running:
    ```bash
    node init.js
    ```
    (This step typically sets up initial data for the application, possibly for the database if Mongoose is used).
2.  Start the main application server by running:
    ```bash
    node script.js
    ```
3.  Look for a confirmation message in the terminal indicating the server is running, usually mentioning a port (e.g., 'Server listening on port 8080').

## Accessing the Application

Follow these steps to view the application in your browser:

1.  Once the server is running, open your preferred web browser.
2.  Navigate to the following address: `http://localhost:8080/posts`.
3.  You should now see the main content of the application, likely a page displaying posts.

## Additional Notes

This project uses Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and accessible if the application requires it for full functionality beyond initial data seeding by `init.js`.
